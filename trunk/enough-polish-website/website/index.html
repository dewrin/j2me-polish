	<h1>polish</h1>
	<p>Use polish for your J2ME-GUI development.</p>
	<h2>Problems of the Java 2 Microedition</h2>
	<p>The Java 2 Microedition is <b>the standard</b> for the
		development of mobile applications, but it brings several problems with it:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>fragmentation of the J2ME market.</b>
			<br />
			There a zillions of J2ME-enabled devices out there and everyone of it
			has special features, limitations and bugs!
		</li>
		<li><b>GUI design is... tough!</b>
			<br />
			The design of the GUI of J2ME-applications is complex, to say the least.
			So the average designer has great difficulties designing a J2ME-application.
			The usual solution is, that the programmer of the business logic also
			needs to design the application. To be honest, this is not the best
			solution!
		</li>
		<li><b>No seperation of design and development.</b>
			<br />
			Designers cannot apply their knowledge without the help of the developers
			in J2ME applications. Regularily the programmer will develop the application
			and when the application has been finished, a designer will give some
			hints how to improve the design and usability of the application. This
			causes often quite a headache. Why can't developers and designers
			work independently at the programs?
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>polish is the solution!</h2>
	<p>polish allows you to keep in pace with the zillions of J2ME-devices.
		The design of J2ME-applications is done with CSS-files, so it's really
		easy and designers can work on the design independently of the developers!
	</p>
