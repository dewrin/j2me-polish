	<p>J2ME Polish makes it easy to adjust the design to specific devices or
	device groups. You can try completely different designs just
	by using a different resources-folder. For the application
	screen-shots a simple <a href="screenshot-application.html">application</a> is used, which just shows
	a main menu with the standard <code>javax.microedition.lcdui.List</code> 
	class.</p>

	<h2 id="other">Other Designs</h2>
	<p>Please send me your designs to <a href="mailto:j2mepolish@enough.de">j2mepolish@enough.de</a>,
	so I can add them to this list.</p>
	<h2 id="items">GUI Items</h2>
	<p>J2ME Polish supports all MIDP items, e.g. the choice-group and the gauge item:<br/>
	<img src="images/screenshot-gauge-plain.png" alt="Gauge and ChoiceGroup."  width="176" height="209" align="right" />
	</p>
	<p>
	The text- and date-input fields can be layouted to get a clear and good looking form.
	This example uses - as every other one on this page - only the standard MIDP GUI widgets.
	The programmer does not need to learn a new API.<br/>
	<img alt="TextField and DateField in action." src="images/screenshot-input.png" width="201" height="268" />
	<img alt="The label and the textfield are on the same height." src="images/screenshot-input-line.png" width="542" height="168" />
	<br />
	In this example the label and the input text are set on one height, this makes the design
	much clearer and calm.
