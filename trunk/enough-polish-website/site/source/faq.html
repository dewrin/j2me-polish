	<p class="questionText">Q: How much memory does J2ME Polish need?</p>
	<p>A: J2ME Polish itself is a build-tool with an optional GUI and some
	helper classes. If you just use the build-tool, no additional memory
	is used. If you want to use the GUI the additional needed memory
	depends on what GUI features you actually use. 
	The minimum library footprint starts around 15 kb (after obfuscation). 
	For a full fledged application calculate up to 40 kb for the GUI.
	Modern devices have a maximum jar size of several MBs, so the memory
	used by the GUI is more or less negligable.</p>
	<h2 id="licensing">Licensing</h2>
	<p class="questionText">Q: When can I buy a commercial license?</p>
	<p>A: From June 15th 2004 onwards.</p>
	<p class="questionText">Q: What happens when J2ME Polish will not be developed anymore?</p>
	<p>A: When the development on J2ME Polish will be halted, Enough Software will license
	   the full product under the GNU Lesser General Public License, allowing
	   full commercial usage without limitations. Thus Enough Software
	   offers a very high investment security!</p>
	<h2 id="bugs">Bugs</h2>
	<p class="questionText">Q: I think I have found a bug, what should I do?</p>
	<p>A: Please tell me about it at <a href="mailto:j2mepolish@enough.de">j2mepolish@enough.de</a>.
	You might also want to file a 
	<a href="http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?group_id=1246">bug-report</a>.
	J2ME Polish is currently in the &quot;early bird&quot;
	phase, so there are still some limitations.
