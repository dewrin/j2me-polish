	<h1>variables for pre-processing</h1>
	<p>
	polish knows several variables and switches which can be set directly or indirectly in the polish.xml file.
	All switches and variables start with &quot;polish.&quot;, so you should not encounter
	any difficulties with your own switches or variables.
	</p>
	<p>
	This documented is targeted at developers who wants to use polish-specific variables or switches
	in their own widgets or canvasses.
	</p>
	<h2>Switches</h2>
	<p>
	Switches are used to indicate specific properties. They are often mutually exclusive with others.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>polish.images.backgroundLoad</b>: this switch is set when images of the widgets, 
				backgrounds and canvasses should be loaded in a background thread. This can speed
				up the responsiveness of an application dramatically, but it also means that
				some images are set while the user is in a screen. This switch is mutually
				exclusive with the switch <code>polish.images.directLoad</code>.
				This switch is set indirectly in polish.xml by the <code>imageLoadStrategy</code>-tag.
				</li>
		<li><b>polish.images.directLoad</b>: this switch is set when images of the widgets, 
				backgrounds and canvasses should be loaded in the foreground thread. 
				This can slow down the responsiveness of an application, but it also means that
				all images are loaded when the user enters a screen. This switch is mutually
				exclusive with the switch <code>polish.images.backgroundLoad</code>.
				This switch is set indirectly in polish.xml by the <code>imageLoadStrategy</code>-tag.
				</li>
		<li><b></b>: </li>
		<li><b></b>: </li>
	</ul>
