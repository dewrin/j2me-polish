	<h1 id="top">Installation</h1>
	<p>For installing J2ME Polish <a href="../download.html">download</a> the
	latest release and start the installation either by double-clicking the file or
	by calling &quot;java -jar j2mepolish-<%= PolishVersion %>.jar&quot; from the command-line.
	It is recommended to install J2ME Polish into a project-folder of your workspace,
	e.g. &quot;$HOME/workspace/j2mepolish&quot;.
	<br/>
	The installer of J2ME Polish contains a sample MIDlet application with
	two different designs. This application is optimized for Nokia Series
	60 devices, so it is recommended to have such an emulator installed. The
	Nokia emulator can be retrieved from <a href="http://forum.nokia.com">http://forum.nokia.com</a>.
	<br/>
	To build the sample application, run the included build.xml from your
	favorite Java IDE or call &quot;ant&quot; from the command-line. Call
	&quot;ant notest j2mepolish&quot; to build and obfuscate the sample
	application.

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements for Installing J2ME Polish</h2>
<p>
To use J2ME Polish, following components need to be installed:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Java 2 Standard Edition SDK 1.4  or higher, 
	<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">http://java.sun.com/j2se/</a>
	</li>
	<li>Java Wireless Toolkit, 
	<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/j2mewtoolkit/index.html">http://java.sun.com/products/j2mewtoolkit/index.html</a>
	</li>
	<li>Favorite IDE, for example Eclipse 3.0, 
	<a href="http://www.eclipse.org">http://www.eclipse.org</a>
	</li>
	<li>Ant 1.5 or higher, if not already integrated in the IDE, 
	<a href="http://ant.apache.org">http://ant.apache.org</a>
	</li>
	<li>Optionally device emulators, e.g. the Nokia J2ME emulator, 
	<a href="http://forum.nokia.com">http://forum.nokia.com</a>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installation">Updating J2ME Polish</h2>
<p>
When you want to update an existing installation, you do not need
to re-install the whole package. For saving bandwidth you can download
just the update-package. This package just containts the two JAR-files
enough-j2mepolish-build.jar and enough-j2mepolish-client.jar which need
to be copied into the &quot;import&quot;-folder of your installation.
</p>
<h2 id="integration">Integrating J2ME Polish into Eclipse</h2>
<p>
To integrate J2ME Polish into Eclipse it is best to install J2ME Polish 
(with the included sample application) into a new folder in your workspace 
called &quot;myproject&quot; (or any other name). 
Then start Eclipse and create a new project called &quot;myproject&quot;. 
Eclipse then automatically integrates all source-files and sets the classpath. 
</p><p>
Optionally you can change the build-settings by
modifying the file &quot;build.xml&quot; (which is located in the root of your project).
<br/>For example you can change the deviceRequirements if you want to. 
The example is optimized to Nokia Series 60 devices. 
</p><p>
You can now create the JAR and JAD files by right-clicking the build.xml file, selecting &quot;Run Ant&quot; and running Ant in the next dialog. 
You will find the JAR and JAD files then in the &quot;dist&quot; folder of the project.
If you want to access them from within Eclipse, you might need to refresh your project:
<br/>Right-click the project and select &quot;Refresh&quot;.
</p><p>
After you have installed J2ME Polish, you will find following structure in your project (assuming that your project is called &quot;myproject&quot; and your workspace &quot;workspace&quot;):
</p>
<table class="borderedTable"  cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" border="1">
	<tr><th>Folder / File&nbsp;&nbsp;</th><th>Description&nbsp;&nbsp;</th></tr>
	<tr>
	 <td>workspace/myproject</td>
	 <td>The applications project</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	 <td>workspace/myproject/build.xml</td>
	 <td>The controller of the build process</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	 <td>workspace/myproject/devices.xml</td>
	 <td>Definition of J2ME devices (only installed when you selected to install the external device database)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	 <td>workspace/myproject/vendors.xml</td>
	 <td>Definition of J2ME device vendors (only installed when you selected to install the external device database)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	 <td>workspace/myproject/groups.xml</td>
	 <td>Definition of device groups (only installed when you selected to install the external device database)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	 <td>workspace/myproject/apis.xml</td>
	 <td>Definition of some common J2ME libraries (only installed when you selected to install the external device database)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	 <td>workspace/myproject/resources</td>
	 <td>Folder for all resources and design descriptions of the project</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	 <td>workspace/myproject/resources/polish.css</td>
	 <td>Basic design description</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	 <td>workspace/myproject/import</td>
	 <td>Needed APIs</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	 <td>workspace/myproject/build</td>
	 <td>Temporary build folder, will be created automatically. Should not be shared in CVS and similar systems.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	 <td>workspace/myproject/dist</td>
	 <td>Folder for the ready-to-deploy applications. It will be created automatically. Should not be shared in CVS and similar systems.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
Tip: You don't need the files &quot;devices.xml&quot;, &quot;vendors.xml&quot;, &quot;groups.xml&quot; and &quot;apis.xml&quot;, since they are also contained in the jar-file &quot;enough-j2mepolish-build.jar&quot;. If you don't want to change them, you can delete them.
