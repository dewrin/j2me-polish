		or Enterprise License.</td>

	    application.</td>

	<p>If you have a question regarding the licensing of J2ME Polish,
	please get in touch with Robert Virkus, <a href="mailto:j2mepolish@enough.de">j2mepolish@enough.de.</a></p>
	<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
	<p>When 3 programmers of your company work with J2ME Polish and you develop
	a game which you will sell about 6.000 times, you would want to obtain
	3 developer seats and the Single License:<br />
	<code>3 x 99,- Euro + 199,- Euro = 496,- Euro</code>.
	</p>
	<h2 id="earlybird">Pre 1.0 Versions</h2>
	<p>You can use the current releases of J2ME Polish without obtaining a commercial
	license. This right expires as soon as the version 1.0 is released. 
	<br/>A special Early Bird License will be available for companies who
	choose to support J2ME Polish already in its current state. This license
	will be available from June 15th 2004 onwards.
	</p>
	<h2 id="security">Security of Investments</h2>
	<p>When the development on J2ME Polish should be halted, Enough Software will license
	   the full product under the GNU Lesser General Public License, allowing
	   full commercial usage without limitations. Thus Enough Software
	   offers a very high investment security!
