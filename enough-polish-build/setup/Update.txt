Please copy the jar-files into the "import"-folder of your J2ME projects.

If you have installed the device database-files, you
might want to extract the device-database files from the
enough-j2mepolish-build.jar file as well. Alternatively you can
just delete the files devices.xml, vendors.xml, groups.xml and apis.xml 
from your project folder.
