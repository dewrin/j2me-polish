CSS-attributes should always named like "font-family", not "fontFamily" (principle of least astonishment) 

The types.xml, borders.xml and backgrounds.xml could be compiled to increase the performance of the
build-process.

When in css-definition only "background-color" is defined, then automatically a simple background
is assumed. When there are "background-image" (and possibly "background-color") defined,
then an ImageBackground is assumed.
